                Elon Reeve Musk FRS is a business magnate and investor. He is
                the founder, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX; angel investor,
                CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring
                Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; president of the
                Musk Foundation; and owner and CEO of Twitter, Inc. With an
                estimated net worth of around $181 billion as of November 18,
                2022, Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to
                the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's real-time
                billionaires list. Musk was born and grew up in Pretoria, South
                Africa. He attended the University of Pretoria before moving to
                Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his
                Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at
                Queen's University and transferred to the University of
                Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics
                and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford
                University, but dropped out after two days to instead pursue a
                business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with
                his brother Kimbal; the startup was acquired by Compaq for $307
                million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded the online bank
                X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. eBay
                bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

          In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space
          transport services company, and is its CEO and chief engineer. In
          2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer
          Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and
          product architect, eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In
          2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was
          later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he
          co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research
          company. The following year, he co-founded Neuralink—a neurotechnology
          company developing brain–computer interfaces—and The Boring Company, a
          tunnel construction company. In 2022, Musk purchased the social media
          platform Twitter for $44 billion. He has proposed a hyperloop
          high-speed vactrain transportation system, and is the president of the
          philanthropic Musk Foundation
